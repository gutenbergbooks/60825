<p>The dicta of the Wise Man concerning
discipline have been the source of inexpressible
dolour to children for very many centuries;
and it has only been within the last
sixty years that ferocity in the treatment of
infants (I am speaking of English children,
Jean Jacques Rousseau shamed the French
out of the practice of beating<!-- TN: original reads "bearing" --> their offspring,
nearly a hundred years ago) has been gradually
diminishing. In the eighteenth century
the lot of the British juvenile was certainly a
<a name="png.004" id="png.004" href="#png.004"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cruel one That admirable woman, the
mother of the Wesleys, held that a child
should be made to desist from crying and to
“fear the rod” at the mature age of twelve
months; and Miss Maria Semple, writing on
education in 1812, tells a story of a lady who
was educated in early years by a relative.
“On a certain day in every week she received<!-- TN: original reads"receiveid" -->
corporal chastisement. If she had committed
faults, ‘the punishment was due;’ if
she had not, she probably would in the week
ensuing. At the distance of more than half-a-century,
the memory of this person, who
bore a public character of piety and virtue,
was spoken of, and justly, with aversion by
the person she had thus treated.” Thus
Miss Maria Semple.—“G. A. S.,” in the
<cite>Illustrated London News</cite>.</p>

<p class="letter-indent">Since writing you my confessions,
in that series of letters which you flattered
me by calling “most interesting facts, and
deliciously voluptuous reading for lovers of
the rod,” the following curious narrative has
been entrusted to my confidential keeping by
a young Countess of my acquaintance; but
as there are no secrets between us, and I
think it may afford some little pleasure in
the perusal, I hasten to copy it out for you,

 </span></span></a>from notes which I made day by day at<!-- TN: original reads "hat" --> the
bedside of the dear young creature, as she
told the particulars to me, at my visits during
her long and painful illness, now, I am afraid,
close upon a fatal termination; and you may
guess how grieved I am to think that, although
I now reserve her name as<!-- TN: original reads "has" --> a secret,
too<!-- TN: original reads "to" --> solemn to be entrusted, even to
you, the stillness of the grave will soon do
away with all necessity for such reticence.
Should my confessions ever be printed
after our time, this tale certainly ought to
bear them company, either as prefix or
addenda.</p>

<p class="fakeh2"><span class="smc">Chapter<!-- TN: original reads "Chapitre" --> I</span><br
 /><i>The Early Life of Lucille</i></p>


<p>Since, dear Rosie, you are so interested to
hear my birching and whipping experiences,
I will try to recollect them as well as possible,
but hope you will consider my weak
state of health, and not press me to tell you
too much at once.</p>

<p><a name="png.008" id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Perhaps you do not know that almost from
my infancy it was arranged that I should
marry the Earl of Ellington, who was about
twelve years my senior, being a family compact
of a purely mercenary character, designed
to consolidate some very doubtful title
deeds, which now that our union has proved
unfruitful, are likely to entail great expense
and annoyance to our heirs-at-law.</p>

<p>My father, you know, was the Honourable
Mr. Warton, and my mother died in giving
birth to myself, so that I was brought up
under a nurse, and afterwards, when about
seven years old, a young lady was engaged
as governess to instil my juvenile mind with
the rudiments of learning, preparatory to
being sent to a finishing school.</p>

<p>This lady’s name was Miss Birch, and
although my papa had known her father, Dr. Birch, for some years, I now believe that the
fascination of her name had great influence
with him in making a selection from the
numerous, and in many instances more
<a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eligible ladies, who applied for the situation.</p>

<p>Miss Birch was a dark lady about thirty
years of age when she entered our family,
very good-looking, rather large pouting
mouth, set off with lovely rows of most pearly
white teeth, which<!-- TN: original reads "wich" -->, when she<!-- TN: comma removed --> smiled or said
much showed to beautiful effect in contrast
to her rather swarthy complexion, dark
brown eyes, and thick bushy black<!-- TN: original reads "blach" --> arching
eyebrows, her figure was well moulded and
plump, and being about five feet six, she had
quite a commanding presence.</p>

<p>I was nearly eight years old before I began
to notice the significant looks which occasionally
passed between papa and governess,
but hints were so often thrown out about the
necessity of procuring a good birch rod for
the naughty bottom of Lucille, that I was
gradually awakened to the discovery of some
most mysterious kind of understanding which
must subsist between them. My infant
brain was much puzzled and alarmed, as I
<a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>already felt in imagination the tingling smart
of the green twigs I so much dreaded.</p>

<p>Miss Birch seemed more exacting and severe
over my lessons, especially when papa
happened to be in the schoolroom, and now
I will tell you my first experience of the
rod.</p>

<p>One day after failing both in spelling and
arithmetic she rang the bell, and ordered the
servant to request Mr. Warton’s presence in
the schoolroom for a few minutes. Papa
entered with a very serious look, requesting
Miss Birch to inform him of the cause of sending
for him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Warton,” said my governess, “you
know we have had many serious conversations<!-- TN: original reads "conversatious" -->
about the necessity for proper correction
in case Miss Lucille should continue so
inattentive to her studies, to-day she has
failed in everything, and I am certain that
unless her energies are sharpened up by the
stinging smart of the rod she will go from
bad to worse; I am so averse to wield the
<a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>birch myself, and would much prefer that
her papa should take in hand the serious
whipping she ought to have.”</p>

<p><span class="smc">Papa.</span>—“Lucille, you hear what Miss
Birch says, (I noticed him cast most excited
and amorous<!-- TN: original reads "amourous" --> looks towards the governess
as he spoke), she has been most forbearing
with you, and interceded with me many
times to save your bottom, and even
now cannot bring herself to lift her own
hand to make you smart a little; it must
indeed be a serious fault to induce her to
ask me to use the rod, but, ‘Spare the
rod and spoil the child,’ has always been
a maxim with me; lay her across your<!-- TN: original reads "you" --> lap,
Miss Birch, and pull up her clothes, whilst
I get the rod out of the table drawer.”</p>

<p><span class="smc">Miss Birch</span>, with heaving bosom, and
quite a deep blush upon her face.—“I feel
as ashamed at baring her naughty posteriors
as if I was going to suffer the degradation
and humiliation myself, but come,
Lucille dear, you must bear it, and I hope
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>you will be a better and more diligent
girl in future.” Then catching me by the
wrist, as I stood by her side covered with
confusion, she tried to lay me across her
knees, but I struggled and screamed,
“No! No!! No!!! I won’t be whipped!
Oh! Oh!! dear papa, do forgive me
this time!” my face quite crimson and
streaming with tears.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Papa</span>, having got out the rod, a fine
switch of long thin birch twigs, tied up
with velvet and silk ribbons at the handle,—“Come!
Come!! Lucille, this resistance
will only make it worse for you.”
As he seized and threw me on the governess’s
lap, Miss Birch securing my head
well under her left arm, speedily pulled
up dress and skirts, till my fat little bottom
was exposed in a tight fitting pair
of drawers, my legs being left to kick
about, although I was quite firmly secured,
and to all intents quite helpless, and
my toes could scarcely touch the ground.</p>

<p><a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>
I could hear papa whisking the birch
about, and then he said, “That will do famously,
Miss Birch, keep her head and
shoulders well down as you hold up her
skirts; much as I pity my darling little
Lucille, I must do my duty and make her
smart for her idleness in school.”</p>

<p>My face was burning hot with the deep
blushes of shame, and I struggled desperately
to free my head from the vice-like pressure
of Miss Birch’s arm, as I begged with
piteous sobs to be let off for this once.
“Oh! dear papa! Oh! pray don’t beat me!”</p>

<p><span class="smc">Papa.</span>—“Indeed, I must, though every
blow will send a pang to my own heart,
you naughty, bad, inattentive girl, all this
has come by your great idleness, and trusting
too much to the kind heart of your governess.”
As he said this, three sharp
stinging cuts whacked on my tight-fitting
drawers in quick succession.</p>

<p>The pain was intense, I kicked, writhed
and screamed for “Mercy! Mercy! Oh!
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Oh!! I will be good! Oh! Papa! Oh,
Miss Birch, do let me go!”</p>

<p><span class="smc">Papa</span>, in quite an excited tone, (for I
could see nothing), “So you mean to be
good in future! Do you feel the birch is
doing you good already? Ha! ha!! my
little Lucille, you must have a little more yet
to make a perfect cure of your<!-- TN: original reads "you" --> idleness.”
Whack—whack—whack—whack—four more
cuts, each one more agonizing than the last,
in spite of my sobbing and screaming.
“Now, Miss Birch,” he continued, “let
her feel it on the bare flesh, open her drawers
so we can see the effects of the cuts.”</p>

<p>This was at once done, as I cried, “Ah!
Ah!! No! No!! Oh, Papa! How cruel!”</p>

<p><span class="smc">Papa.</span>—“<!-- TN: punctuation invisible -->What a sight. The rod has
made her bottom blush finely. It’s best to
make her feel sore a few days, or she will
soon forget it, and relapse into her old
ways.”</p>

<p>The drawers were unbuttoned, and I could
feel they were quite pulled down my thighs,
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>exposing the entire surface of my smarting
rump, but I had only a few moments for
reflection before the blows fell again in rapid
succession, cutting, tearing, and scratching
the skin, whilst the boiling blood in my veins
seemed to throb as if it must spurt through
the pores at every burning touch of the rod.</p>

<p>My head was pressed against the tumultuously
heaving bosom of my governess, and
notwithstanding the intensity of my suffering,
I could plainly hear the beating of her
heart, and knew that her thighs were tightly
compressed together, whilst a strange tremor
pervaded her entire frame.</p>

<p>“There, there, that will do,” said Papa,
in a very excited tone. “I’ve drawn the blood
for her. Now, Miss Dunce, kneel and kiss
the rod, and ask your kind governess to forgive
you.”</p>

<p>I slipped down on my knees, and hiding
my face in my hands in her lap, promised
Miss Birch “if she would forgive me now, to
be a better girl in future.”</p>

<p><a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>
“That<!-- TN: original reads "thad" --> will do. I don’t want to be too
hard upon Lucille this time. We will leave
her to think over her disgrace and shame,
and let her beware of the birch again,”
said Papa, taking Miss Birch’s hand, to
lead her from the room. “This has been a
most agitating scene for your governess,
who must repose in her private room for a
while to recover herself.”</p>

<p>The schoolroom door, which opened directly
into her private room, was closed upon
me, and the key turned in the lock, but<!-- TN: original reads "butt" --> all
my hurts and bruises were insufficient to
distract my attention from the peculiarly
warm and excited glances which passed from
papa towards my governess, whose face was
suffused with blushes, and her eyes turned
down, as if afraid to meet his ardent looks
as they<!-- TN: original reads "the" --> passed from the room.</p>

<p>My curiosity was excited so much, that I
listened at the keyhole. Papa was evidently
remaining in the governess’s room. I
could hear a rustling of her dress, as if some
<a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>little struggle was taking place; a sound of
smothered kisses, and soft expostulatory
ejaculations, such as, “I dare not! Oh!
No! No!! Not now! Pray leave me! Oh!
Oh!!” Then an almost perfect quiet, except
for a slight rustling sound, and, now
and then, broken sighs with heavy breathing.</p>

<p>At last all was quiet, and having now been
left more than half-an-hour to myself in the
schoolroom, I ventured to tap at the door
and beg Miss Birch to let me into her room,
as I would never, never, offend again.</p>

<p>After a very slight delay, the door was
unlocked, and my governess received me
with expressions of great tenderness, kissed
her poor Lucille, and hoped my poor bottom
was not too sore. Her eyes were melting
with what I should now call a soft voluptuous
languor, and scintillated with extraordinary
brilliancy, all of which set my young
ideas in a flutter of wonderment, as to the
extraordinary cause of her prolonged emotion.</p>

<p><a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
Things went on pretty smoothly for some
time, but I found it quite impossible to avoid
coming under the rod every now and then,
the chastisement getting more severe on
every fresh occasion.</p>

<p>Papa always had to handle the twigs, and
when I began to get older, Miss Birch would
tie me up and leave the room, as she pretended
to be quite unable to bear the scene.
Still papa would always go into her sanctum
at the conclusion of my whipping, to talk
the matter over with my governess.</p>

<p>I will tell you of a fearful birching, the
last I had before being sent to the Convent
School; it does not matter what the fault
was, but it must have been something very
serious. Papa and Miss Birch both helped
to tie me up on a four poster bed in my own
room. I was stripped of every thing but
my skirts and drawers, which were all secured
and arranged so as to expose my back
parts in the best possible manner for whipping.
My hands were tied to the bed post
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>high above my head, and making me kneel
on the bed, one leg was secured at the knee
to the same post, my other leg being left
free to kick about.</p>

<p>Miss Birch vanished, and papa arming
himself with a formidable rood, elegantly
trimmed as usual, began by lecturing me on
my fault.</p>

<p>“You impudent girl, I can scarcely believe
it of you, Lucille, now you are just upon
twelve, but this is the last whipping you
will get at my hands, and I promise you it
shall be a sound one, and then I’ll pack you
off to the convent, with instructions to the
sisters to be very strict in looking after
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!! Papa,” I implored, “Have
mercy, don’t be so severe, indeed I won’t do
it again!”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, Miss,” he said, impatiently,
“you always cry before you are
hurt, but you shall remember this whipping
as long as you live;” giving me a slashing
<a name="png.020" id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cut round my loins, then another, and another
on each cheek of my buttocks, “how
do you like it, you bad girl! will you turn
over a new leaf when you leave home? Will
you? Will your? Will you? Will you?”
Each question being accompanied by a terrific
smarter; the blows seemed to cut like
a red hot knife, and my boiling blood tingled
from the tips of my fingers to the ends
of my toes. I could feel great burning bursting
weals rising on my skin at every cut;
I screamed and plunged till the bed-post
creaked with the strain, and my wrists
and knee were quite pained by the tight ligatures
by which they were secured.</p>

<p>“Let this be a solemn warning to you,
Miss Lucille,” he continued, “but I’m afraid
all my efforts for your reformation are quite
thrown away upon such a worthless baggage,”
cutting away still more furiously,
and as I turned my head to scream and implore
for mercy, I could see how excited he
was over the business with flushed face and
<a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sparkling eyes; he was a fine handsome man
of about forty-five, and gave me the idea of
looking as if in the midst of a tremendous
battle.</p>

<p>Anything but a bloodless battle for me;
my bottom was soon dripping with the ruby
drops of my young blood, the sight of which
seemed only to exasperate him still more.</p>

<p>“Ah! You little wretch. Scream away!”
he exclaimed. “It’s a beautiful sight to see
you writhing and plunging under every scathing
cut. May it do you good, and draw
the imprudence out of your tail. Will you?
Will you, try and behave better, or shall I
send you off to the convent at once, in their
holiday time? There! There!! There!!!”</p>

<p>He finished with three tremendous cuts,
without waiting for my reply, and sank
back, gasping for breath, into an easy
chair.</p>

<p>It was quite a minute or two before my
screams and moans of agony subsided.
Then Miss Birch coming in, released my
<a name="png.022" id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hands and leg, an ordering me to rest on
the bed for a while, retired with my father
locking the door behind them.</p>

<p>The smarting sensation now turned to
a delicious voluptuous warmth, as I lay
under the bed clothes. My right hand
was passed all over the glowing surface
of my buttocks, and seemed at last, quite
unwittingly to settle itself on my hairless
little cunny. I turned on my belly with
my hand still under me, and wriggling
myself about, as I lay thinking over all
the cuts I had received, gradually found a
most pleasing sensation from the rubbing
of my hand and the two forefingers mechanically
worked into the slit, squeezing
my legs together, I rubbed on to increase
the pleasurable<!-- TN: original reads "pleasureable" --> emotions which I felt
driving me to strive and obtain, I knew
not what. The frenzy now threw me into
such a state of excitement that my fingers
were plunged as far as possible up my
virgin cunny, as I gasped, writhed, and
<a name="png.023" id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>tossed my bottom up and down. The
crisis came at last, and my furious efforts
were rewarded by a most heavenly emission;
my soul seemed to flow from me at
the moment, and left me in a delightful
state of voluptuous lethargy, which lasted
for some minutes, and when at length I
regained my serenity, it was to find my
fingers, cunny, and thighs<!-- TN: original reads "thigs" --> all sticky from
the thick spermy emission of my first maiden
spend. There was also a slight stain
of blood, for I had actually ravished myself
in my furious excitement.</p>

<p>I got up and sponged myself, then lay
down to reflect on the curious and delicious
emotions I had procured for myself, and determining
to soon have a repetition of my
secrets joys, fell asleep to dream of being in
the arms of a most lovely boy about my own
age, who seemed to impart to my ravished
senses another taste of what I had already
felt.</p>

<p>Awaking in a struggle to retain my
<a name="png.024" id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>love-bird, I found myself bedewed by another
emission, but at last I slept with tranquility,
and<!-- TN: original reads "aud" --> never shall I forget my first taste
of joy that day.</p>

 /><i>The Convent School</i></h2>


<p>My father’s extreme severity made me
rather glad when in about a week’s time
Miss Birch began to make preparations
for my departure to Belgium, and in less
than three weeks I found myself installed
as a pupil in the seminary of the Ursuline
nuns at Brussels. The Lady Superior struck
me from the very first as being a frightfully
severe woman; the morning after
<a name="png.026" id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>my arrival she sent for me to hear her
read my father’s instructions, and remarked
that he had given her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche<!-- TN: original reads "blanehe" --></i> as
to punishment, and that in their school
discipline was strictly enforced. “Remember,
young lady,” said she, in dismissing
me from her presence<!-- TN: original reads "presenee" -->, “we never overlook
a fault, and that my word is law here.”</p>

<p>My face flushed with indignation, and
tears filled my eyes as I left the apartment,
fully assured in my own mind that I must
soon experience a taste of their discipline,
nor had I long to wait, for two days after,
having confidentially expressed my disgust
to another pupil, with respect to the coarse
fare set before us at meals, I soon found I had
been talking to a tell-tale spy, who carried
everything to the Superior.</p>

<p>An elderly nun quietly told me she had
been sent to conduct me to the private room
of the Lady Superior. My time was come,
and I followed my chaperone with trembling
anxiety.</p>

<p><a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Our Superior was a stern looking woman of
about forty-five, with dark piercing eyes and
Roman nose, thin compressed lips considerably
adding to the severity of her expression.</p>

<p>“Mdlle. Lucille,” said the superior, “I
thought the caution I gave you on your arrival,
would at least have saved you from trouble
for some time, and spared me the pain of
inflicting personal correction on you so soon
after your entry into our seminary, but I
am afraid your papa must have had serious
cause for wishing me to be severe with you;
now what have you been saying to your
fellow pupil the Mdlle. Olive; did you remark,
‘<!-- TN: original uses double quote -->that the food was not fit for a dog,
much less schoolgirls’<!-- TN: original lacks closing quote -->?”</p>

<p>I looked down in confusion, “Ah, I see,”
she continued, “you cannot deny it; well
Lucille, I hope soon to convince you that our
bill of fare is both wholesome and proper for
the pupils, I shall give you one dozen cuts
with the rod, and then let you off if you promise
not to offend in the same way again.”</p>

<p><a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The nun who was called Serena, now placed
a long stool in the middle of the apartment,
and made me lie on it full length face downwards,
then I felt her cold busy hands as
they turned up my clothes, and opened my
drawers behind, till my bottom was left
naked to the attack of the Lady Superior.</p>

<p>“Do you, Mdlle. Lucille,” she asked
sternly, “consider that our fare of bread
and porridge three times a day, and meat or
soup twice a week, added for dinner is only
fit for a dog? Ah! Ha!” she went on, cutting
me slowly and severely at every few words,
“This will give you a better appetite; how
do you like birch sauce, Miss Dainty Mouth<!-- TN: original reads "Mout" -->?”</p>

<p>I screamed with the pain, and plunged
about so that Sister Serena had to hold me
down with all her weight upon my shoulders.
“Forgive me, oh, forgive me this
time, I won’t speak to Olive again!” I gasped
out as the heavy woman almost
stopped my breath, but at last it was over,
and after kissing the rod and making me
<a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>look at the blood-stained weals on my bottom,
they sent me away with a caution how
I spoke about that or anything else I might
see done in the convent.</p>

<p>I longed to have my revenge on the
deceitful Olive, but knew not where to turn
for a confidant, they all perhaps would be
equally treacherous. I stuck to my lessons
and avoided punishment as much as possible,
being assured that the longer I brooded
on my revenge the more complete it would
be in the end, at the same time I thoroughly
studied every part of the building to which I
was allowed access, in the hope I might some
day find it very useful if I wanted to effect
my escape.</p>

<p>The nuns I believe slept in dormitories,
where there were a dozen or more together,
but every pupil had a very small room to
herself, mine was in a long corridor, and
Olive’s three or four doors from mine, there
were neither locks or bolts to any door, as
the Lady Superior and elder sisters were
<a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>supposed to take frequent peeps at us in our
sleep; I had at last matured my plan, and
having everything in readiness, one dark
night when there was not even a glimpse of
moonlight, I patiently watched till some of
the principals had paid the accustomed visit,
and heard the cracked voice of an old nun
say, “fast asleep,” as I feigned to be in a
deep slumber.</p>

<p>Soon their footsteps died away in the corridor,
and after waiting some time, till I felt
sure every pupil must be again asleep, if the
going round should have awakened them, I
crept out of bed, and providing myself with
some pins and a strong piece of cord, was soon
at the bedside of the treacherous girl I wanted
to serve out; my first act was to quietly
pass my cord around her, outside the small
bed, so that I could suddenly draw it tight
and secure her a helpless victim in my power
then suddenly stuffing the bedclothes into
her mouth before she could scream out, ordered
her in a rough whisper to keep quiet<!-- TN: original reads "quie" -->
<a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or I would kill her; it was too dark to see
her terrified face, but she shuddered all over,
and seemed as if her very blood was chilled,
so cold did she seem to my touch.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of her fright, hands
and feet were instantly tied so that she was
spread out in a helpless fashion; I made her
own handkerchief, which<!-- TN: original reads "handkerchieff, vhich" --> I happened to get
hold of, into a gag, and at the same time
could feel the drops of cold sweat upon her
temples. Now I turned up the bedclothes
or pushed them off, as I was tying the cord,
till she was quite naked from the bosom
downwards.</p>

<p>My hands roved over the soft, firm, naked
flesh of her belly, then to the mount of love,
which I found just beginning to be fledged
with silky down. My fingers sought the
crack below, and I could not help amusing
myself by frigging her with all my might,
the two first fingers of my right hand ruthlessly
pushing into her cunny, and I knew
caused her intense pain; from the slight
<a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>groans which the gag could not entirely suppress.</p>

<p>What pleasure it was to me to torture her
by my roughness, and outrage her every
sense of modesty, although I was too ignorant
at the time to know that my fingers
were actually taking the poor girl’s virginity;
a kind of fury possessed me, and I actually
bit the lips of her cunny, and munched off
as much of the silky down as I could bite
away; the pain must have been intense, and
her writhing, shuddering agony was so much
bliss to me.</p>

<p>At last to finish her off I got a piece of the
cord, and passing it right along her crack,
tied it round her thighs and waist as tightly
and painfully as possible, and then for ornament
stuck a lot of pins in the plumb cheeks
of her bottom and left them there.</p>

<p>My revenge was complete, so wiping my
fingers on the bedclothes, for fear of any
blood-stains, &amp;c., I left my victim just as
she was, to be tormented by her horrible
<a name="png.033" id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pains and fears till some one might find it
out, and release her in the morning.</p>

<p>This outrage was never discovered, my victim
was found insensible next morning, and
remained in a delirious state for three or four
weeks before she recovered consciousness,
and then the agony and terror she had endured
on that awful night had so turned her
brain that she believed it was the devil who
had so grossly ill-used her, but I heard that
one of the father confessors was strongly
suspected of having committed the atrocity.</p>

<p>The Superior<!-- TN: original reads "Supertor" -->, with whom Olive had been
a favourite, now vented her spite in every
direction amongst the young lady pupils of
the seminary, and I for one soon fell under
her displeasure, and was ordered to be tied
up to their whipping post; it was only for
slightly oversleeping myself, and not dressing
quickly when the bell rang for us to get
up at 6 <span class="allsc">A.M.<!-- TN: original reads "A. M." --></span></p>

<p>I was suspended by my wrists being tied
high up the post as I stood upon a small
<a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>footstool<!-- TN: original reads "footsotol" -->, then it was suddenly kicked away,
the jerk of the sudden strain on my wrists
almost making the straps cut into the flesh.
My feet were dangling some inches from the
ground, “Oh! Oh! Ah—r—r—r—re!”
I screamed, “How cruel! Oh! Papa! Papa!<!-- TN: punctuation invisible -->
If you only knew how they are treating me
in this awful place!”</p>

<p>Lady Superior (who seemed delighted at
the sight of my pain),—“Hold your foolish
noise, Mdlle. Lucille, wait till you have something
to scream about, girl.” Then the
old Serena, who it seemed was always in
attendance at punishment time, pinned up my
skirts and opened my drawers behind, and
the Superior went on, “This rod shall make
all the sluggards turn out quicker in the morning;
what do you think, Mademoiselle, of
making us all wait prayers for ten minutes<!-- TN: original reads "minntes" -->?
will you wake—wake—wake up sharper in
future?”</p>

<p>She gave me three smarting cuts at each
word, and my suspended position added so
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>much to the intensity of my pain, that I
screamed, kicked, and plunged about as I
swung by my wrists from the post. “Sister
Serena,” exclaimed the Superior, “keep the
girl steady or I cannot plant my cuts as effectually
as I ought to do upon her naughty
impudent bottom, she shan’t sleep for a
week if I can<!-- TN: original reads "ean" --> only make it sore enough!”
Serena now held me to<!-- TN: original lacks "to" --> the post with one hand,
to prevent my swaying about, whilst the rod
rained a succession of withering, scorching
cuts on my buttocks, and just underneath
the parting of the cheeks of my bottom. My
screams were heartrending, but they only
seemed to enjoy it more and the Superior
never ended her objurgations till the rod was
worn out.</p>

<p>Things now went on till I was nearly fourteen<!-- TN: original reads "four.een" -->,
we never had a holiday, and only short
letters came to me from home, in which my
father constantly expressed his hopes of my
improvement, and seemed quite oblivious to
all I had written from time to time about my
<a name="png.036" id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>severe treatment, and begging him to remove
me to some other school.</p>

<p>I afterwards found out that my home
letters were regularly<!-- TN: original reads "regulardy" --> suppressed, and others
more suitable were written and sent to papa,
in my name; what wretch that Superior now
appears in my eyes, she not only delighted in
whipping us nearly to death, but forget letters
to our parents so as to keep her pupils,
and make everything appear <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couleur de
rose</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps, dear Rosa, you have heard that
I managed to escape from that dreadful convent,
but previous to that they nearly killed
me. I was getting quite a big girl, my pussey
already sported its silken down on the Mons<!-- TN: original reads "Mons." -->
Veneris, which we all consider such an ornament
to our secret charms.</p>

<p>The Superior had lately taken much notice
of me, and introduced me to a clique of her
favourites, three or four pretty girls about my
own age, who were often indulged with little
treats in her private room; there, we girls
<a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>were encouraged and instructed in all kinds
of lascivious ideas; we looked at each other’s
cunnies, tickled and kissed each other in
every possible way, the Superior encouraging
us, and suggesting a variety of attitudes
for us to try. She had a huge godemiche,
about nine inches long, and very thick,
which she would fit upon one of the girls,
and then submit herself to be fucked as hard
as possible, whilst the other girls had to turn
up the girl’s skirts, and smack her bottom
hard and fast, with the palms of their hands,
to make the young gentleman (as the Superior
called her partner) work fast and vigorously.</p>

<p>Then she would have us all strip naked,
whilst we had in turn to kiss and suck her
cunt, when it was all slimy with her spendings.</p>

<p>I did not mind the slapping, or allowing
any one to kiss and tongue-fuck my cunny,
but the Superior’s was so hairy, and had
such meaty looking lips, and a huge clitoris,
<a name="png.038" id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>(which I now know is induced by long-continued
self-abuse), and it smelt so fishy,
that I absolutely declined the honour of gamahuching
her, and nothing could induce
me to do so.</p>

<p>This so enraged her that she flew at me
like a tigress. I was knocked down, and
beaten with a thick stick<!-- TN: original reads "Stick thick" -->, till my flesh was
bruised<!-- TN: original reads "bruiced" --> all over, and then picked up,
almost fainting, and hurried off to my own
little room.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing further would have happened,
but in my innocence, I supposed my
letters were sent home just as I sealed them
up, so I wrote to Miss Birch a full account of
what I had been seduced into, and the
dreadful beating I had received, for not liking
the cunt of the Lady Superior.</p>

<p>The very next day after I thought the letter
was gone, the old nun, Serena, fetched me
into a dull gloomy room, which I had never
been in before, but at once rightly judged to
be a punishment chamber, when I saw a high
<a name="png.039" id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whipping post, made of a square beam, set
upright in the floor, with two rings near the
top on each side, by which to tie up the
victim; a birch<!-- TN: original reads "bireh" --> rod was hanging on the
wall, and two scourges with long things lay
upon a seat at one end, but I had no time for
further observation, as the Superior seemed
to follow us into the room almost immediately.</p>

<p>“Now, Mdlle. Lucille,” she exclaimed,
grinding her teeth in rage, “you shall rue
the insult you put upon me the other day,
before my special favourites, of which I had
minded to make you one, so that when you
left the seminary you might look back with
pleasure to the loving amusements I had
first introduced you to; perhaps I should
have overlooked it all, but see I have your
letter. Ha! Ha!! you little fool to think that
would ever go out of the convent!”</p>

<p>Sister Serena had by this time put me on
a stool, and was fastening my wrists one on
each side of the post, and presently the stool<!-- TN: original reads "stoo" -->
<a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was removed, and I found myself just touching
the floor with the tips of my toes.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful position, how she will
twist about and scream when she feels the
scourge, make haste to bare her bottom, as I
am burning to pay her out. Ha! Ha!! Mdlle.
Lucille, I fancy you wouldn’t mind kissing
my cunt now if I promised to let you off,”
said the Superior spitefully.</p>

<p>My courage and natural obstinacy came to
my assistance at the moment, I was so indignant,
and the idea was so repulsive to me
that I resolved rather to die than do that for
her; I was frightened and yet flushed with
shame and indignation at my treatment, besides
something seemed to advise me to irritate
my tormentor to do her worst, and get
it over quickly.</p>

<p>“No! No!! No, never!!! you may kill me,
and then I should be out of my misery!” I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>She scowled with ferocity, but said with
all the calmness she could command, “<!-- TN: punctuation invisible -->make
<a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>haste, Serena, up with her clothes, and open
the drawers well, and keep her as steady as
possible.” Then taking up the instrument of
punishment I could see it consisted of five
or six long thongs of whipcord, plaited and
knotted at the ends, fixed on a very elastic
handle.</p>

<p>It was poised in her hand for a moment,
and then brought down with stinging force
on my exposed buttocks, then again, and
again, and again, in quick succession; each
cut seemed to sear the flesh as if done by a
red hot iron, my piercing screams filled the
whole place, and the Superior, her eyes sparkling
with ferocious joy,<!-- TN: punctuation invisible --> jeered me about how
I liked the scourge. “How lovely you look,
Mdlle. Lucille, as you plunge and scream,
and I know the intense agony of every cut;
would you rather die now, my little dear?
Well, I’ve a good mind to kill you, outright,
only I want to keep you as long as that
<em>dear, kind papa</em> of yours is willing to pay!
How he must have loved his Lucille, to place
<a name="png.042" id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her with me; I’m so kind, so very kind, you
know, my dear girl! What do you think of
my kindness, you little love?”</p>

<p>Her cuts were awful, and I swayed and
plunged so that it was impossible for Serena
to keep my body steady, so she seized the
other scourge, and tried her best to second
the Superior in her efforts to cut me up more
and more.</p>

<p>At last they fairly panted for breath, as I
was left dangling, sobbing and moaning,
with my clothes torn, my drawers in shreds,
and streaming with blood all down my
thighs and legs.</p>

<p>Fearing I might faint, they poured a little
strong cordial down my parched throat,
sponged my face with cold water, and put
some strong snuff up my nose, which almost
drove me into convulsions, so very violent
was the fit of sneezing produced.</p>

<p>They seemed carried away with delight at
the sight of my sufferings, and sprinkled a
quantity of the snuff over the cuts on my
<a name="png.043" id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bottom, just to dry up the blood, as they
said with a laugh. Next all my clothes
were cut or torn off, till I had nothing on but
slippers, stockings, and the remains of my
drawers.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll finish off the obstinate, impudent
little beast, I wish I dare kill her,”<!-- TN: original reads "’" -->
said the Superior, grinding her teeth, “only
I should lose too much, she is worth more
alive than dead.”</p>

<p>A couple of lady’s riding whips were now
produced, and the two women attacked me
afresh; I was cut all over my body, each cut
seemed as if done with a red hot knife, the
blood flowed down my back in streams, and
yet their rage seemed to increase at the sight
of my sufferings. My screams were awful,
but only so much music to their ears. They
jeered and derided my cries for “God to
have mercy on me, &amp;c.,” said “my time
was come to die, but they would make me
last as long as possible, and draw out my agony
to the very last gasp.”</p>

<p><a name="png.044" id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>This must all have passed in a very short
time, but was an age of intense suffering to
me, and the finale was such a display of ferocity
that I sank under it, and thus robbed
them of the pleasure of prolonging my torture.
The Superior seized me by the hair,
and drawing my head back, lashed her whip
across my face and bosom, drawing more
blood at every cut, whilst old Serena, not to
be outdone, took my right leg under her arm,
cut me dreadfully<!-- TN: original reads "dread-fully" --> inside my thighs, along
the crack of my pussey, and made the tip of
her whip<!-- TN: original reads "wip" --> reach the Mons<!-- TN: original reads "Mons." --> Veneris.</p>

<p>This was the last I could recollect, but
when I came to myself I was in my own bed,
wrapped up in cloths soaked in water. No
bones were broken, and my health soon
recovered sufficiently to enable me to effect
my escape, and avoid their further malice.</p>

<p>It was about 3 <span class="allsc">A.M.</span> one fine morning
when I escaped from the Ursuline Convent;
and made my way to the Hotel d’Angleterre,
the porter in answer to my summons was
about to refuse to give me refuge, when a
young Englishman, who was just taking his
candle in the hall, said, “he’d be damned if
I should not be taken care of,” and ordered
the chambermaid to be called to attend on
<a name="png.046" id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>me, and added that he would be responsible
for all expenses. “Certainly, my lord,” said
the porter of the hotel, but he added <!-- TN superfluous opening quote removed --><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto
voce</i>,<!-- TN superfluous closing quote removed --> “<!-- TN opening quote inserted -->I think he’s a fool to be so easily imposed
upon.”</p>

<p>I was too glad to have found a protector,
(especially when I found he was an aristocrat),
so I quietly followed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</i>,
and was content to await awhile for the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">denouement</i> of my adventure.</p>

<p>Breakfast was brought to me about eleven
o’clock, and also a message to say that Lord
Dunwich, would do himself the pleasure of
waiting upon me in an hour’s time.</p>

<p>You may be sure I was all impatience to
see the kind fellow who had stood my friend,
and was most agreeably surprised to find his
manners quite equal to his appearance when
I saw him again.</p>

<p>His Lordship was greatly interested by the
account of my escape from the convent, and
said he was a very particular friend of my
betrothed husband, the Earl of Ellington,
<a name="png.047" id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and would put me under the protection of a
lady going to England, who would see me
safe home. He was such a handsome fellow,
and my gratitude was so gushing that at
the moment I could have refused him no
thing, and was delighted by the way he
lingered over a kiss, he would insist upon as
his due, my whole soul seemed to leap
towards the generous fellow, and tears of
disappointment stood in my eyes when he
was gone.</p>

<p>I never saw him again till my wedding
day, two years later, when he was best man
to my husband, and in my eyes looked a
thousand times more loveable.</p>

<p>A married couple of sixteen and twenty-eight
ought to have been blessed with every
happiness, but after the first three days of
our honeymoon the Earl’s temper seemed so
overbearing and imperious, that I began
seriously to regret my fate, and looked forward
to a life of gilded misery. The Earl was
fond of the turf, and often left me alone
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whilst he spent a fortnight at Newmarket or
Doncaster and York.</p>

<p>One day I was agreeably surprised by
a call from Lord Dunwich, (we were living
in Grosvenor Square at the time), he looked
more handsome than ever, and seemed<!-- TN: original reads "semed" --> so
full of sympathy for me in every respect that
I could<!-- TN: original reads "Icould" --> not help falling into tears, and telling
him all my fears, and how I was neglected
for nasty ugly fourlegged brutes of race-horses,
and<!-- TN: original reads "aud" --> that in fact I was sure Lord Ellington
loved his Derby favourite better than
myself, and would rather I broke my neck
than his pet should fall lame.</p>

<p>“Ah, Lucille” he said, falling on his
knees before me, “how your distress<!-- TN: original reads "distrees" --> cuts
me to the quick, would to God I could comfort
you in any way! I have loved you from
the first moment we met, although I knew
you belonged to a bosom friend, and now
the wretch slights you; look up, dear Lucille,
from your tears, smile upon one who
is devoted to you body and soul!” And
<a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>then seizing my hand, upon which he imprinted
a lot of impassioned<!-- TN: original reads "impassionned" --> kisses, “Ah,
you will pardon my presumptuous love, how
can I help it?”</p>

<p>I was piqued by the Earl’s coldness towards
me, and something impelled me to pity the
handsome suitor at my feet, so that although
the tears were still welling<!-- TN: original reads "welting" --> from my eyes,
could not help smiling<!-- TN: original reads "smilling" --> and caressing his
head as he looked up to my face.</p>

<p>“Darling Lucille, I may call you so now,
you respond to my love, my happiness is too
great,” he exclaimed, drawing my unresisting
body down, so that our lips quickly met
in a rapturous kiss of real love.</p>

<p>I was lost, and he so rapidly took advantage
of everything, that proceeding from one
liberty to another, in less than ten minutes I
was an adulteress<!-- TN: original reads "adultress" -->, but what a sweet sin, what
transports of love shot through our souls
as we melted away again and again in the
ecstasies<!-- TN: original reads "extasies"; OED does not list this as a variant spelling --> of mutual enjoyment; how we toyed
with each other’s most secret charms, and
<a name="png.050" id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>promised to renew our forbidden pleasure
at every convenient opportunity.</p>

<p>Alas, for our happiness<!-- TN: original reads "hapinness" -->, some spy informed
the Earl of my sweet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaison</i>, he made
an excuse<!-- TN: original reads "exsuse" --> to visit Brussels with me and
again I found myself incarcerated in a hateful
convent<!-- TN: original reads "couvent" -->.</p>

<p>The kindness of my husband on our journey
from England (which I afterwards found
was only a part of his most artful programme),
had so imposed upon my rather
soft-hearted nature, that I really<!-- TN: original reads "realy" --> felt sorry
that I ever been unfaithful<!-- TN: original reads "unfaithlul" --> to my marriage
vows, although no doubt the image of my
loving paramour was firmly imprinted in my
heart.</p>

<p>We went to operas, bal masques, saw all
the sights, and enjoyed ourselves immensely
for a few days and being strict Catholics he
one day said jestingly, “I suppose, Lucille,
we must go to confession, and get absolution
after having enjoyed ourselves, and confess
all the delightful sins we have committed;
<a name="png.051" id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by-the-bye, be sure you do not forget to
confess having ridden a St. George on your
husband, and allowed him to spend his seed
in your hand, or on your pretty bosom, they
are most awful sins, and will cost a pretty
penny for absolution. I should not be surprised
if the Rev. Father undertook to inflict
personal chastisement <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Girard et Cadière</i>,”
he added, laughing.</p>

<p>“But, seriously,” I answered, “apart
from joking, I know we ought to do it, and
will go to that church in the Rue de la Madeleine
this very day, I know I am a sinner,
but don’t like to make a laugh of such serious
things.”</p>

<p>Then seating myself on his knee, I drew
his face to mine, and kissed him lovingly,
as I added, “But, dear Francis, you won’t
leave your little wife so long again, will you,
for those horrid horses? You can’t imagine
how dull and low spirited I get when left all
by myself.”</p>

<p>“What a pretty pouting little bride you
<a name="png.052" id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>look. Why, Lucille, the way you kiss excites
me as if we were still on the honeymoon
trip; but dearest,” he added, “a sporting
man must see his horses tried and run, then,
you, know, I shall make up in the winter
what you lose in the summer; there’s nothing
else to do then but to make love. Ha,
you sweet little devil, do you want to commit
another sin before confession?”</p>

<p>My hand had been gently caressing<!-- TN: original reads "carressing" --> his
prick outside his breeches, till it was now
rampant and impatient of the restraining
cloth.</p>

<p>“Well,” he went on, following my
example, by passing a hand up my clothes,
and gently tickling my clitoris with his forefinger,
“<!-- TN: punctuation invisible -->we’ll lump it all together, so there
won’t be any more to pay. My Stars, Lucille,
how excitable you are. You’re spending
on my fingers. It’s nothing to blush
about, little simpleton.”</p>

<p>I got off his lap, and kneeling before him,
unbuttoned his flap, and the engine of love
<a name="png.053" id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>seemed to leap into my hand, its fiery head,
with the skin turned back, looked so tempting,
that I could not resist the temptation
to kiss and caress it for a few moments. My
tongue played lasciviously round the tender
and excitable surface, whilst my hands, were
fondling his finely developed balls.</p>

<p>“Darling! Darling!” he ejaculated. “It’s
coming! Oh! I can’t stop—kiss—kiss<!-- TN: original reads "hiss" -->—suck
it. Take it in your mouth, Lucille! Oh! Ah!
How delicious! You darling, to think you
would give me so much pleasure!”</p>

<p>I was as excited as himself, and sucked
and swallowed his delicious spendings to
the very last drop, as he pressed my head
down with his hands, and gasped out his
hands, and gasped out his ejaculations of
ecstasy<!-- TN: original reads "extasy"; OED does not list this as a variant spelling -->.</p>

<p>“Now, it’s my turn, Sir. I mean to have
a St. George, as you lie on the hearthrug.
Come, down with you at once, or I will bite
it off,” making him feel my teeth, as I playfully
took it again in my mouth.</p>

<p><a name="png.054" id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>We had a delightful bout on the hearthrug,
and I rode him till he spent into my excited
cunt a third time. Keeping his cock stiff,
and starting him again after each<!-- TN: original reads "eaeh" --> spend by
the contractions of the folds of my vagina,
which he declared gave him the most exquisite
and voluptuous sensations, and that he
had never experienced anything to equal it in
his life, many women as he had had in his time.</p>

<p>Presently I told him that as soon as I
could get dressed I would go to confession.</p>

<p>“Do love,” he replied, “and if the Confessor
is reasonable with you, I will go
myself to-morrow, or send for him to wait
on me at the hotel.”</p>

<p>I left him smoking a cigar<!-- TN: original reads "eigar" -->, and about an
hour-and-a-half afterwards entered the
church, where I was immediately accosted
by an elderly priest. “<!-- TN: punctuation invisible -->If the English lady
wishes to confess, the Father Francisco<!-- TN: original reads "Framcisco" --> in
yonder box is most suitable for Madame.<!-- TN: punctuation invisible --> He
knows the English ways so well, and was
consecrated in England.”</p>

<p><a name="png.055" id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>I approached the box, which was in a very
secluded corner of the sacred building, and
kneeling on a hassock, enquired, in a low
voice, “If the Rev. Father Francisco was
ready to hear my confession?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my daughter, and I pray God you
may have nothing but venial sins to confess,”
was the reply of my unseen Confessor.</p>

<p>In my innocence I related every act of our
married life; how excited we were in our
love games, and the various attitudes we
used to heighten our enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Awfully sensual, my daughter. Your
Confessor previous to marriage must have
admonished you as to the use of these unnatural
postures in following the dictates of
nature in your endeavours to obey the first
commandment, ‘<cite>to increase and multiply</cite>.’
The holy rites of matrimony ought not to be
perverted by lascivious ideas and filthy
sacrifices to lust. It is a most serious thing
my daughter, but before I consider what
penance to exact for such sins, tell me, as
<a name="png.056" id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>you value the intercession of our Holy
Mother, have you always been faithful to
your husband? If only by a look or a gesture,
it<!-- TN: original reads "et" --> is important to your<!-- TN: original reads "jour" --> salvation hereafter
that you should confess it now.”</p>

<p>I was silent, dumbfoundered<!-- TN: archaic but OED says OK --> for a moment
or two. “Ah! my daughter, conceal nothing.
Alas! it is as I feared—conceal nothing from
me, or it will be impossible for me to grant
you absolution.”</p>

<p>Thus pressed, and feeling but a full
confession would avail me with the Confessor,
I told him everything, and especially how
sorry I felt at having allowed my pique at
the Earl’s neglect to have carried me into
such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaison</i>, and that the tender regard he
had lately exhibited towards me smote me
to the quick for my unfaithfulness, and that
that was the reason I had so given way to
lasciviousness<!-- TN: original reads "lasciviouness" --> with him, in order to compensate,
by the perfect abandon of my love, for
any suspicions he might entertain.</p>

<p>“My daughter<!-- TN: original reads "daugter" -->, I must consult our Superior.
<a name="png.057" id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Yours<!-- TN: original reads "Your’s" --> is such a serious case, and I beg that
you will go into the vestry, by the door
behind this box, and wait a few minutes, till
I bring you his decision,” said Father Francisco.</p>

<p>I was all of a tremble, my face felt hot with
blushes of shame and I longed to hide from
observation<!-- TN: original reads "abservation" --> for a few minutes, so I readily
went into the vestry, as he had requested. It
was a bare scantily furnished room, with a
few chairs, a writing table covered with
papers, and some priests’ frocks and vestments
hanging round the walls.</p>

<p>Presently the old priest who had accosted
me on my first entering the church, came to
conduct me to Father Francisco’s room, but
instead of that, I found myself in the cell of
a convent, with the door locked behind me.</p>

<p>The worst fears assailed my frightened
mind; I sank on my knees, calling on God
and my husband to release me, crying and
stamping in impotent rage by turns; this
must have lasted an hour or two. Then a
<a name="png.058" id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>little wicket was opened in the door, and the
same old priest told me to calm myself, for
Father<!-- TN: original reads "Falher" --> Francisco and the Superior were
praying to the Holy Mother to direct them
what penance to impose upon such a sinner,
and that I must remain where I was till next
day, when, he added, “no doubt you will
be restored to your loving husband, as pure
in mind and spirit as when you first took
your marriage vows.”</p>

<p>I was going to implore him to allay the
Earl’s anxiety on my behalf, but he assured
me they had sent to his lordship to say that
I was doing penance for some hours in their
convent, and quickly closed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guichet</i>, so
that I was again left alone.</p>

 /><i>The Penance</i></h2>


<p>Two nuns supplied me with refreshment,
made me up a bed on the floor, and I really
had nothing to complain of as to treatment
that first night, still, something seemed to
assure me that I really was a prisoner<!-- TN: original reads "prisonner" -->, and
should not so easily get out of the convent.
My hope was, that the Earl would speedily
insist upon my speedy release, (little dreaming
at the moment that he was the instigator
<a name="png.060" id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of my detention, and had actually acted as
confessor in the assumed name of Father
Francisco.)</p>

<p>My anxiety was greatly increased the next
day, when hour after hour passed, and still
no communication from the Confessor or Superior,
the nuns who brought me in breakfast
and dinner were silent to all my enquiries or
offers of bribes if they would help me get out
of the place.</p>

<p>My watch had stopped for want of a key,
but about seven o’clock<!-- TN: original reads "o’ clock" --> in the evening, as
near as I could guess, the old priest opened
the door, and beckoned me to follow him.
My heart suddenly recovered its courage, and
I braced up my nerves to bear the severest penance;
we passed along several passages, and
at last opening a door, he motioned me to enter.<!-- TN: punctuation invisible -->
There, sitting before a small table, which had
a bible and crucifix upon it, sat a rather
young priest, about the same age as my
husband, but with a close shaven face and
crown (the Earl had heavy whiskers and
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>moustache, I had never seen him otherwise),
and he struck me as being very like Francis
about the nose and eyes, still, no suspicion
that it could really be him<!-- TN: original reads "gim" --> came into
my mind.</p>

<p>“Daughter Lucille, Lady Ellington,” said
the seated Confessor, as the other locked the
door behind me, “In answer to prayer, the
Holy Mother has inspired us to grant you
absolution, only after the most severe personal
chastisement and humiliations we can possibly
inflict upon you. Then, you will<!-- TN: original reads "wil" --> return
to your confiding loving husband, purified of
your adulterous sins, but for all that, he will
still, and for the rest of his life, wear the
horns of a cuckolded husband, which is his
punishment for teaching you such lascivious
ideas; it is an awful sin to so abandon yourselves
to lust, and your unfaithfulness is the
providential punishment he so well deserves.”</p>

<p>My face and neck were suffused with the
blushes of burning shame, as my eyes fell
beneath his ardent gaze, besides something
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>instinctively told me that both Father Francisco
and his coadjutor were enjoying the
sight of my confusion.</p>

<p>“Now please divest yourself of everything
you have on, except corset, chemise and
drawers, whilst I prepare this scourger for
the chastisement of your wicked sensual flesh,
and my brother here will get that rope in
order, ready to tie up your hands above your
head.”<!-- TN: punctuation invisible --></p>

<p>I scarcely knew how I got my dress and
skirts off, as my hands trembled so, and the
idea of stripping before two men, even if
they were priests, was so distressing to my
sense of modesty, but, somehow or other,
I was soon standing up, with my skirts on
the floor, about my heels, and my last under
petticoat tucked up under my corset.</p>

<p>Father Francisco confronted me, scourge
in hand, and pointing with his finger to my
drawers in front, roughly ordered me to open
them, and show where I had admitted my
lover, when in the act of committing adultery.</p>

<p><a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>“Open it, you wicked woman. I must see
the seat of lust itself!”</p>

<p>He flourished his scourge so, and gave<!-- TN: comma deleted --> me
two such terrible cuts round my buttocks,
that I was compelled to obey his immodest
and shameful order, and the moment I had
done so, he produced a pair of scissors and
denuded me of<!-- TN: original reads "hof" --> nearly all the dark, silky
chevelure I took such delight in viewing in
the glass, when ever I dressed myself, or just
got out of my morning bath.</p>

<p>“I suppose you were so excited and wanton,
when Lord Dunwich embraced you,
that you shewed him everything, even your
nakedness, as the Bible calls it; did you
blush then, as you pretend to do now, Lucille?”
he asked.</p>

<p>My surprise and indignation almost choked
me, so that I was unable to speak, and he
gave me a heavy slap with his hand on my
bottom, saying, “So you will not answer,
and think I am behaving shamefully, do you?
It’s nothing to what you will have to submit
<a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to presently, Lady Ellington; turn round
and open your legs, and stoop forward this
instant, or I will flog the very life out of you!”</p>

<p>His rude hand was passed under my bottom,
between my legs, and as I covered my face
with my hands, I could feel his fingers invade
every secret spot in turn, even to forcing
a digit up the fundamental orifice,
which is always so tight and difficult of entrance,
saying, as he did so: “Did you let
him go there, or has your husband ever sodomised
your bum-hole? Ha! Ha! How
modest we are now. Speak; say if you
ever allowed any one to put his prick in your
arse?”</p>

<p>I cannot recollect all he said or questioned
me about, but his words and actions were
every moment more and more coarse and
obscene, on purpose to add to my humiliation.</p>

<p>“Here, Father Anthony<!-- TN: original reads "Antony" -->,” he continued,
addressing the old priest, “where is your
godemiche? That’s the thing to draw all the
<a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wantonness<!-- TN: original reads "wantoness" --> out of her lustful body. It is well
furnished with good stiff bristles?”<!-- TN: punctuation invisible --></p>

<p><span class="smc">Father Anthony.</span>—“It’s a new one,
same as we always keep in stock to subdue
the fleshly lusts of these lascivious female sinners,
and never used before, but I must tie
her up.”</p>

<p>The rope, which hung from a pulley in the
ceiling, was tied tightly round my wrists,
bringing both hands together; then he pulled
it as hard as possible till I could barely touch
the floor with my feet, and all my weight was
upon my arms and the muscles of my back.</p>

<p>“That’s it, exactly,” chuckled Francisco.
“Now, my dear Lucille, Lady Ellington I
ought to say, you will really enjoy the insertion<!-- TN: original reads "inserttion" -->
of this jolly dildoe up your cunt, and it is
full of a delightful injection, with which it<!-- TN: original reads "if" -->
will spend in response to your emission of<!-- TN: original reads "ol" -->
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Ah! No! No! Oh pray don’t treat me
with such brutality,” I screamed, in horror,
when I saw the huge red-headed thing, with
<a name="png.066" id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>its shaft springing from a bed of bristles, fixed
round the balls so as to prick the cunt at
every insertion, besides its length and thickness
seemed quite terrible to contemplate. “I
am quite content to submit to your penance
of scourging and whipping, but oh, oh, have
mercy, and put that thing out of my sight.”</p>

<p><span class="smc">Father Francisco.</span>—“Look, you need
not be so frightened. I shall lubricate it well
with perfumed oil to make it enter you easily,
besides I will put some on your cunt and
bottom.” Suiting his actions to his word, and
oiling my privates profusely, especially my
bottom-hole, which he lubricated till he
could easily work two fingers in at once.</p>

<p>It was dreadfully disgusting, but still his
frigging my bottom was rather exciting, and
he could tell or guess my feelings, as he went
on to say, “I see you like it, but the dildoe
will make you plunge and spend with
delight.”</p>

<p>He then took up my legs; one under each
arm, and stood between them, so they were
<a name="png.067" id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wide apart, and Father Anthony<!-- TN: original reads "Antony" -->, his face
plainly showing how he<!-- TN: original reads "ge" --> delighted in the task,
proceed to force his godemiche<!-- TN: original reads "godemuche" --> into me,
opening the lips of my cunt with his fingers
till the head was fairly in, then ruthlessly<!-- TN: original reads "ruthessly" -->
shove, shove, shove, till, “Ah! Ah! Oh!
Ah—r—r—r—re!” I screamed in dreadful
pain, as the sharp bristles ran into the tender
surroundings of my pussey<!-- TN: original has "pussy", altered for consistency -->. “Ah! Ah! Oh,
my God!” I screamed plunging and writhing<!-- TN: original reads "writing" -->
in my agony, his eyes glared into mine with
a fiendish delight, only equalled by the look
of his companion, who held my legs like a
vice, and encouraged him to fuck the wanton
woman till she had had enough to keep her
out of adultery<!-- TN: original reads "adultere" --> for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Presently Father Francisco, digging his
nails into the flesh of my legs, said excitedly,
“See, see, she’s coming. The gluey spend
is glistening on your dildoe. Now, now, shoot
it into her; let her enjoy it!”</p>

<p>In a moment I felt the hot gush of the contents
of the godemiche. It rather relieved me
<a name="png.068" id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for a moment or two, but oh, oh, my dear,
even after this long lapse of time, I can never
forget the agony of that moment. The whole
of my body seemed filled with liquid fire, for
they had filled the dildoe with some infernal
decoction<!-- TN: original reads "decotion" --> on purpose to ruin my health, and
destroy all chance of my ever enjoying the
sweets of love again. Such I know was their
intent, for they taunted me with it at the time;
but although<!-- TN: original reads "alrhough" --> I never quite recovered from the
shock to my system, and feel even now that
it was the original cause of my premature
decay, they did not succeed in depriving me
of all sensual desire or feelings for the
future.</p>

<p>I fainted, but they never let me down, and
when at last I began to recover consciousness
Father Francisco was using his scourge most
unmercifully<!-- TN: original reads "unmercilully" --> on my buttocks, the drawers
being open, and the naked flesh exposed to
every cut.</p>

<p>“I thought this would bring her round”,<!-- TN: original reads ",”" -->
exclaimed he. “See, Father Anthony, her
<a name="png.069" id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eyes are opening, it will soon make her forget
the dildoe fucking, she did enjoy that, did
she not, Anthony? But she’ll be a long time
before she has such pleasure again. Ha! Ha!
Ha!!! how<!-- TN: original reads "h6w" --> lovely she is getting, see her
wriggle from the pain of every<!-- TN: original reads "evety" --> cut. Ah, Lucille,
dear Lady Ellington, what intense delight
the sight of your agony is to us.”</p>

<p>By this time either he was tired, or he
thought a little respite would enable me to
bear more presently, so dropping the scourge
on the floor he left me still suspended, whilst
himself and assistant sat down and gloated
over the sight of my suspended figure and
blood-stained bottom, with their hands under
their frocks, and I verily believe now they
were frigging themselves.</p>

<p>After about ten minutes Father Francisco
again approached, scourge in hand, whilst the
elder priest gave me a few drops of cordial,
and held some pungent salts under my nose to
refresh me a little. “That will do,” said the
former, “stand back, Father Anthony<!-- TN: original reads "Antony" -->. Now,
<a name="png.070" id="png.070" href="#png.070"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>now, you wicked, wanton, lustful young woman,
did you wish your husband dead when
having connexion with Lord Dunwich? Why
don’t you answer? Were his parts more pleasing
to your sensuality? Is he better furnished
than your husband? Speak up; confess all
your wickedness! Did no sense of shame
shock you in the midst of your enjoyment
with that fellow, eh?”</p>

<p>Every question brought a scathing cut with
it, breaking the weals and drawing fresh blood
at every stroke, but I really was so ashamed
I knew not how to answer, and my tongue
was useless except for moans or cries of pain,
and notwithstanding all their degrading and
cruel treatment I felt it was fully deserved
by me.</p>

<p>“Won’t you speak? won’t you confess
your sorrow for your sin?” he continued.
“Are you really so lost to all sense of shame
as to be hardened against repentance? This
must be whipped, yes, whipped out of you,
even if it nearly costs your life!”</p>

<p><a name="png.071" id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Just then Father Anthony loosed the rope
a little, so that I could shrink further from the
blows of the scourge, till I was driven up to
the wall, where I stood on tiptoe with my
hands drawn up over my head, and my back
bending as much as possible to avoid the terrible
shower of blows with which he was cutting
up my buttocks still more and more.</p>

<p>Crimson with shame, tears flowing in torrents
from my starting eyes, I moaned, cried
and implored for mercy, protesting in a broken
voice, “That ever since my husband had renewed
his kindness to me I had been very,
very sad and ashamed of myself for what I
had done, and only his former neglect had
caused me to throw myself into the arms of a
handsome man to whom I was under great
obligations for protecting me when I escaped
from the Ursuline Convent.”<!-- TN: punctuation invisible --></p>

<p>“Ha, then, you are that Lucille who insulted
Lady Superior, I heard all about it at the
time!” he went on furiously. “Now you
shall be punished for that too,” seizing my left
<a name="png.072" id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>leg<!-- TN: original reads "eg" --> and lifting it up, so that he could cut freely
under my thighs, on my sore cunny, and every
tenderest spot he could think of, whilst old
Father Anthony was rubbing his hands in delight
at the sight.</p>

<p>My agony was so intense that I could only
gasp and sigh, strength I had none, he seemed
beside himself with rage, but at last dropped
his scourge, and throwing open his frock in
front I could feel his rampant pego thrusting
towards my mount, and am sure he spent on
my drawers outside before he could get into
me; this he soon effected, and taking my buttocks
up in his strong embrace, he fucked furiously,
swaying me about with my arms still
tied up by the rope; but I forgot all that, his
motions within me took away all feeling of
pain, and I believe much as I loathed him and
felt humiliated by all his dreadful treatment
that I actually spent copiously when I felt his
hot sperm shooting into and soothing my
overheated cunt.</p>

<p>He was so overcome that Father Anthony
<a name="png.073" id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>seeing he was about to fall, released me, or
loosened the rope so that we sank down together
on the floor, and laid almost motionless
for a few minutes, till the old priest, taking
up a scourge, began to whip us both unmercifully,
and made Francisco get up. This was
the end for that time, but I was ordered to
prepare for a final penance in a day or two’s
time.</p>

 />∼∼∼∼∼∼∼∼∼∼∼∼</h2>

<p>They kept me in the same chamber, where
I had been so outraged, the two nuns nursing,—bathing
my bruises, and using soothing injections
to allay the inflammations of my privates,
till, on the third day, they said I was so
far recovered that my Confessors might finish
the prescribed penance, adding, with a malicious
smile, “we saw everything last time,
and so we shall now, through our peepholes;
<a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>how delicious the sight was last time, and we
had such frigging and dildoe fucks after it was
all over.”</p>

<p>Having said this, they speedily disappeared
and I was left to await my fate in trembling
anxiety; I was hot and cold by turns, as the
recollection of all the humiliating and painful
incidents of the other day came back so vividly
to my mind, and in imagination I seemed to
suffer all my tortures over again.</p>

<p>This did not last long, although you may
be sure it seemed long enough to me in my
state of apprehension. A key was turned in
the lock, and the door creaked on its hinges;
my persecuting confessors again stood before
me in reality, with quite a sardonic expression
of anticipated pleasure on their faces; no trace
of pity could I find on either visage, nothing
but gloating sensuality seemed to animate the
ardent looks with which they regarded me for
some moments.</p>

<p>The hateful Francisco was the first to address
me, a smile of terrible meaning playing
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>round his mouth, showing his pearly white
teeth to such perfection that I was again
strongly reminded of my husband.</p>

<p>“Lady Ellington, I hope, has had good
time for reflection upon the heinousness of her
sins, particularly those in contravention of her
marriage vows; wantonness is as nothing
compared to that. What has the penitent
Lucille to say? Has her chastisement made her
feel the pangs of real remorse?” he said,
whisking a scourge before my face.</p>

<p>I was too frightened to speak; face, neck
and bosom, I could feel, were in a burning
heat, whilst my eyes could not meet his, for
something more than shame instinctively told
me what I might have to suffer at his hands.</p>

<p>“No sign of repentance here, Father
Anthony; she must be stripped naked at once<!-- TN: original reads "onee" -->.
Do you hear, Lucille? Strip—strip—strip at
once, or it will be much the worse for you!”
he said with rough ferocity.</p>

<p>Both priests helped me to undress, and in
their impetuous haste almost tore the clothes
<a name="png.077" id="png.077" href="#png.077"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>off my back, at the same time taking all sorts
of disgusting liberties, and keeping me in a
continued state of confusion, at last when
nothing was left but my chemise to remove,
they suddenly tied the rope round<!-- TN: original reads "roond" --> my left
ancle, and in an instant I found myself suspended
head downwards, with the right leg
kicking in the air, and screaming piteously
for mercy.</p>

<p>“Secure her wrists to the rings in the floor,”
said Francisco, “and then help me to whip
the seat of lust till she is a little more
repentant.”</p>

<p>The elder priest speedily effected this, and
then both of them with scourges commenced
to whip me most mercilessly, aiming their
relentless cuts between my legs so as to cut
the lips of my cunt and round my bottom-hole
at every blow; now and then the cruel thongs
would wind round the upper part of my
thighs, or on to my mount; my cries were
heartrending, as each blow seemed<!-- TN: original reads "sermed" --> to re-open
all my old cuts and bruises. “<!-- TN: punctuation invisible -->Ah! Ah—r—r—re!
<a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Oh! Oh!! will you never have pity, and
believe me sorry for my faults?” I screamed
or moaned, and gasped out the words in
intense agony.</p>

<p>“So you begin to repent a little under the
lash, do you, Lucille, are you really sorry for
having wronged Lord Ellington, is it your
mind or your cunt that is most filled with remorse?
How you seem to writhe, and how
prettily we are making it look for you,
the trickling blood is delightful to see as it
flows in drops and rills over your back and
belly!” His questions were spoken slowly
as he seemed to enjoy the pleasure of my intense
suffering, and two or three of his cuts
were over the tender surface of my belly or
right across the navel.</p>

<p>“Scream away, you sensual woman, why
don’t you implore the Holy Virgin to have
pity and forgive you, we are only carrying
out her commands, are we not Father
Francisco?” hissed out old Anthony, as he
continued to scourge my back and sides, and
<a name="png.079" id="png.079" href="#png.079"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>every now and then aimed a fearful blow
right down my lacerated cunny. Again they
would stop for a little, and ask me jeeringly,
“about my feeling of remorse, would I indulge
in such obscenity with my husband again,
or keep from adultery in future?”</p>

<p>I was almost too far gone to do more than
moan, and Father Anthony suggested that I
ought to be well lashed over my neck, shoulders<!-- TN: original reads "shoulhers" -->,
and bosom, to make me speak out, but
the other seeing how exhausted I really was,
restrained his mad fury, and then after waiting
a little one of them would give me a terrible
cut, and ask the other to see the beautiful
effects of it as I swayed about in agony; this
was done again and again, till after a time the
scourges were thrown aside, and the rope
being lowered I was allowed to lay on the
floor for a little while, and some cordial was
again administered to refresh me, my tormentors
sitting down and frigging themselves
openly before my face, till in the act of spending
they would stand over me so that I might
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be thoroughly humiliated by having all their
spendings drop on my face, neck, or head, as
I was still secured to the floor by my wrists.</p>

<p>Presently, at a sign from Francisco, his
companion hoisted me up by the ancle again,
and did it so tightly that I was frightfully
stretched by my arms and leg; which were
drawn as painfully tight as he could make it,
the fastenings cutting into the flesh so that I
bear the marks to this very day, I could see
that Francisco was again preparing his godemiche
with oil, but he did not put any upon
my person.</p>

<p>Horrified at the sight, I begged and implored
them in the most piteous manner not to
degrade me again with that disgusting instrument,
promising to pay the Church any amount
for absolution rather than endure it
again.</p>

<p>“Too late, too late, your repentance is not
sincere, besides, the other day we saw with
our eyes how your lascivious nature responded
to the thrusts of this thing in your cunt,
<a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>now I am going to degrade your bottom-hole
by inserting it there, however painful the operation
may prove,” saying which he seized,
and held my left leg under his arm, and standing
close to my body at once proceeded to
carry out his infernal idea of ravishing my
anus. Lacerated, bleeding, and sore as my
bottom was at the least touch, and regardless
of my piercing shrieks, he forced the oily
head of the india rubber thing quite into my
tightly contracted bum-hole, the pain was intense,
as it seemed to rend the lining tissue of
the anal canal in its passage, and the bristles
round its root added, if possible, still more to
the intensity of my suffering.</p>

<p>I believe, that giving one long shriek of
agony, I lost consciousness for a time, but
only to awake and find them<!-- TN: original reads "them them" --> laughing
and jeering at my sufferings, as the one worked
his dildoe in my bottom, whilst the other had
thrust two or three fingers up my blood-stained
and wounded cunt. It is quite indescribable
what I felt at this outrage, the accumulation
<a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of shame, agony and horror so overpowered
my exhausted nature, that I went off again
into such a death-like swoon, that they really
feared I was dead, and made haste to let me
down as well as apply strong restoratives.</p>

<p>My hands were still retained in the rings on
the floor, and the godemiche was left sticking
in my bottom, the spasmodic contractions of
the sphincter muscle holding it as in a vice,
whilst the pulsations of the violated passage
behind were still awfully<!-- TN: original reads "fully aw" --> painful. All this
was apparent to me as I slowly came to myself
once more, and could see the excited looks of
my cruel Confessors, who proceeded to sprinkle
me with cold water, and use a large sponge
for the purpose of both refreshing me and allowing
them to gloat over the extent of my
hurts.</p>

<p>This lasted a little while, then I was made
to get up on my hands and knees, facing
Francisco, who then opened his frock, so as
to show me the excited state of his prick, at
the same time, with a malicious look of fiendish
<a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>joy, he asked me, “If I should not like
to suck such a delightful sweetmeat?” Then
seeing my look of intense disgust, he burst
into a rage, saying, “Oh! So you mean to
insult me as you did the Lady Superior of the
Ursulines, do you, Lucille? You may think
I am disgusting and nasty, or I smell strong
as she did, and I may tell you, to make you
relish it still more, that scarcely an hour ago
it was up the strong smelling cunt of that very
same lady, and I was careful not to wash, so
that you might have the full benefit of the delicious
aroma of her spendings.”</p>

<p>Speechless with disgust, and helpless in
every way, it was useless for me to appeal for
mercy or consideration from two such heartless
beings; the only thing I could do was to
close my eyes to the awful sight.</p>

<p>But only for a moment, a tremendous whack
from Father Anthony, who had taken up the
scourge, made me shriek out again, “Ah! Ah!
Oh! Will you never finish me off, and kill me
in mercy?” The only answer I had was a
<a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>quick repetition of the blow, whilst the repulsive
Francisco’s right hand, clutching my hair,
pulled my head up, and drew it back so painfully,
that I gasped for breath. This was
exactly what he wanted, and, in a moment,
his prick was forced into my mouth. The
sensation was so repulsive, horrible, and
choking all at once, that I had not the presence
of mind to bite, or he would have repented
the act ever after. Old Anthony was cutting
my back, bottom, thighs, and loins, even the
calves of my legs not escaping his frenzied
scourging. Blood was streaming over my
flesh, and dripping to the floor in little pools,
and I felt I was really dying at last. Just then
the excited Francisco shot a deluge of hot
sperm into my mouth and throat; I was choked,
and remember no more, except, that on
recovering consciousness, the supposed Confessor,
Francisco, was dressed as a gentleman,
and I immediately recognised him as my husband,
as, at the same instant, he exclaimed,
“Woman, my revenge is complete. You won’t
<a name="png.085" id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>deceive me again. How I have revelled in degrading,
humiliating, and torturing my adulterous
wife. You’ll never see me more. This
has been my way of divorcing myself from a
faithless bitch.”</p>

<p>He was gone before I could find words to
reply, but my sense of pain was instantly
drowned in a deep desire for vengeance for
this outrage, and its impulse so strengthened
me, that<!-- TN: original reads "hat" --> I was soon well enough to travel.</p>

<p>My lover, Lord Dunwich, received me with
open arms, and declared he would shoot or
be shot by the Earl ere forty-eight hours had
elapsed; at once despatching a friend with his
cartel to arrange a meeting for the next morning
in Hyde Park at the dawn of day.</p>

<p>We spent the night together at his hotel,
although scarcely fourteen days since I was
so fearfully outraged, how we fucked all
night, and swam in sensual pleasures for hours,
I would deny him nothing, was he not my
champion, who was going to risk his life in
the morning to avenge my fearful wrongs, and
<a name="png.086" id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to make him still more earnest in<!-- TN: original reads "it" --> his desire
for vengeance, I stripped naked, let him examine
every part, where the marks of the bruises
and lacerations were still visible; my cunt
he sucked, kissed and fucked till I was beside
myself with excitement, and he was also ready
for anything, then my poor bum-hole attracted
his attention, he kissed and put his tongue
into it, till I was eager to have him there, and
begged he would put his<!-- TN: original reads "is" --> prick in gently at first
for fear of hurting me too much; this
was a heavenly finish to our night of
love; we swam in delight, never before or
since have I tasted voluptuous joy to equal
that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enculade</i>.</p>

<p>Next morning dressed as a young gentleman
with a false moustache, I went as one of his
seconds to the fatal place of meeting, and had
the satisfaction of seeing my wrongs avenged
by a ball through the heart of my hated husband.
We then went abroad for a while, but
my dear lover lost his life by drowning in the
Rhine, since which I have consoled myself
<a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as you know by all sorts of erotic fancies, especially
flagellation, and now dear Rosa at
the early age of twenty-five I find myself fast
fading away.</p>
